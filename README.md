# Nightscout Sisensing CGM Uploader
Script written in python to periodically upload Sisensing (SiBionics) CGM (CG1) glucose data to Nightscout.

*Only tested with the Chinese CGM and database. A Chinese mobile number is required for signing up.

## Configuration
The script takes the following environment variables

## IMPORTANT for Azure free tier users
Enable `server side retry` to prevent rate-limiting errors for Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB operations. Follow link below for details.

## Obtain Sisensing API Bearer Token
- Register and run your Sisensing (SiBionics) app on mobile phone first.
- Install a packet capture app on your mobile. eg. Http traffic capture for iOS. PCAPdroid for andriod.
- Install the required certificate per the packet capture app instruction.
- Scan Sisensing app to find the `bearer token` from the relevant https request.
- If Sisensing app is reinstalled, you may need to repeat the above step.

## Hashing Nightscout API token
`ns_api_secret`  must be a SHA1 hash of an Access Token from Nightscout (Add new subject first in Nightscout's Admin Tools if required), e.g. your Access Token for a subject named Sisensing might be `sisensing-123456789abcde`.

Obtain your hash with
```
echo -n "sisensing-123456789abcde" | sha1sum | cut -d ' ' -f 1
```
(use shasum instead of sha1sum on Mac)

which will print the hash (40 characters in length):
```
14c779d01a34ad1337ab59c2168e31b141eb2de6
```
You might also use an online tool to generate your hash, e.g. https://codebeautify.org/sha1-hash-generator

## Deployment - Docker

Docker Hub
https://hub.docker.com/r/imlovinit1019/nightscout-sisensingcgm-uploader

* **API secret and token are passed as Environment Variables.** If you have security concerns, please stop using this script or fork this repository to make improvements. (Docker swarm mode may be required to use secrets.)
